# 2D Shooting Game

This project is a classic 2D shooting game where players control a spaceship (or character) to fight off waves of enemies. The game features responsive controls, dynamic shooting mechanics, and various enemies with unique behaviors. Players aim to survive for as long as possible while defeating enemies and earning points. 

## Features

- **Player Control**: Smooth and responsive movement and shooting mechanics using keyboard or gamepad input.
- **Enemy Waves**: Multiple types of enemies with different movement patterns and difficulty levels.
- **Shooting Mechanism**: Players can shoot projectiles to destroy enemies. Different types of weapons (e.g., laser, bullets) may be available.
- **Scoring System**: Players earn points for each enemy destroyed, with higher scores for tougher enemies.
- **Health and Lives**: Players have a limited number of lives and health points. The game ends when health is depleted.
- **Power-ups**: Collect power-ups that enhance shooting speed, increase damage, or provide temporary invincibility.
- **Background Music and Sound Effects**: Engaging background music and sound effects for actions like shooting and taking damage.
- **Responsive UI**: A simple yet effective user interface showing score, health, and other game stats.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python (with Pygame), C#, or JavaScript (if you’re using a web framework like Phaser)
- **Framework**: Pygame / Phaser / Unity (depending on the platform used)
- **Graphics**: 2D Sprites for the player, enemies, and projectiles.
- **Audio**: Background music and sound effects.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2d-shooting-game.git
   ```

2. Install any necessary dependencies (if using Python with Pygame):

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Controls

- **Movement**: Arrow keys or WASD for movement.
- **Shooting**: Spacebar or a designated key to shoot projectiles.
- **Pause**: Press `P` to pause the game.

## Future Improvements

- Add a leveling system for players and enemies.
- Introduce more weapon types and enemy bosses.
- Implement multiplayer or co-op modes.
- Add more immersive animations and particle effects.
